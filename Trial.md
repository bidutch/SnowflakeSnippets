The trial continues for 30 days (from the sign-up date) or until youâ€™ve used up all your free credits, whichever occurs first. At any time during the trial, you can cancel the trial or convert the account to a paid account by entering a credit card. At the end of the trial, the account is suspended. You can still log into a suspended account, but you cannot use any features, such as running a virtual warehouse, loading data, or performing queries. To reactivate a suspended trial account, you must enter a credit card, which converts it to a paid account.

If you have very specific criteria you want to evaluate, you need to choose the edition that offers this during trial:

* Materialized views: Enterprise, Business Critical
* Time Travel beyond 1 day: Enterprise, Business Critical
* Several security features (rekeying, encryption: Business Critical
* Multi Cluster warehouses: Enterprise, Business Critical

For all other features, any edition can be chosen.
