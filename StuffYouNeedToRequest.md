#Stuff you need to request

Some features cannot be enabled using the Snowflake interface, but they need to be requested via Snowflake Support. This is the list of topics I know of so far:

[The ALL Role] (https://docs.snowflake.net/manuals/LIMITEDACCESS/role-all.html)

[The forgot password link] (https://docs.snowflake.net/manuals/user-guide/admin-user-management.html#disabling-the-change-password-functionality-for-users)
