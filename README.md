# SnowflakeSnippets
Collection of Snowflake specific code snippets, initialy meant to be my private collection, but looking forward to collaborate on this.

Snowflake date dimension is the first entry. The repository contains both a markdown file with some comments as well as a .sql file with the actual code.
