# SnowflakeSnippets
Collection of Snowflake specific code snippets, initialy meant to be my private collection, but looking forward to collaborate on this.

In general, you can find files in a structure with .sql and .md extensions with similar names:
* Something.sql and Something.md, so a piece of sql code should always be accompanied by an markdown file documenting the code. Do not pin me on that.

30-11-2020: major change to the structure of the repo, since I was not too happy about it. 
Some of the content was developing more or less like a copy of the Snowflake documentation, which is excellent, so please consult that. 
Making a change and focussing really on some added value scripts. 
The initial plans:

* a date-time dimension section
* adding history to the snowflake views (especially for usage), combined with the TASKS feature
