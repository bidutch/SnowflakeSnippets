# SnowflakeSnippets
Collection of Snowflake specific code snippets, initialy meant to be my private collection, but looking forward to collaborate on this.

In general, you can find files 

* in folders: e.g. starters and advanced, however, some files are still in the root
* Something.sql and Something.md, so a piece of sql code should always be accompanied by an markdown file documenting the code. Do not pin me on that.
